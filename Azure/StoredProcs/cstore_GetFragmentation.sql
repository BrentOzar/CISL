/*
Known Issues & Limitations: 
	- Tables with just 1 Row Group are shown that they can be improved. This will be corrected in the future version.

Changes in 1.0.3
	- Solved error with wrong partitioning information
	+ Added information on the total number of rows
	* Changed the format of the table returned in Result Set, now being returned with brackets []	

Changes in 1.1.0
	+ Added new parameter for filtering on the object id - @objectId
	* Changed constant creation and dropping of the stored procedure to 1st time execution creation and simple alteration after that
	* The description header is copied into making part of the function code that will be stored on the server. This way the CISL version can be easily determined.

Changes in 1.2.0
	+ Included support for the temporary tables with Columnstore Indexes (global & local)
